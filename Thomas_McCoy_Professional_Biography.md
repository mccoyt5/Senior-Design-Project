### Project Sought:

I have two different directions for my project I am interested in. I would like my project to be related to one of these ideas.

The first direction is a project that allows me to practice my front-end development skills. This could be a project like a web application. 
My front-end development experience has been very minimal so I'd like to gain more. I'm taking User Interface 1 this year so the project would also allow me to develop the skills I learn in the class.

The other direction I'd be interested in is a project involving the Linux kernel.
I enjoyed the Operating Systems & Systems Programming class and think a project going more in depth would be both fun and good for my professional development.
